# Attempt 1

# Target:

#     Get the set-up right - Done

#     Set Transforms - Done

#     Set Data Loader - Done

#     Set Basic Working Code -Done

#     Set Basic Training & Test Loop --Done

#     Start with a network with less than 10k parameters - Basically a good start

# Results:

#     Parameters: 9198

#     Best Training Accuracy: 98.9267

#     Best Test Accuracy: 99.31
# _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Analysis:

#     Model is generalizing well with lower training accuracy and higher test accuracy

#     Optimizing model in the next step to increase the test accuracy with same model

#     Since we have already included batchnorm and dropout in attempt1 we will experiment various data augmentatin methods
